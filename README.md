# Pandas-Data-Analysis-Practice
Summer practice on pandas library for future machine learning

This is simply a collection of my past, present and future practice to gain familiarity with python's pandas module.
It is a module to manipulate dataframes which turns out to be very useful for making quick changes to Excel files 
and passing clean data to machine learning algorithms. 

The project is composed of 3 directories:

Datasets: Where I store the files I will be working on
Practice: My practice to some questions I found online
Tutorials: Guided coding from tutorials found online and on youtube

I am by no means an expert on this. Just sharing my answers and the way I code for everyone to see.
I'm new at the Github thing, so just trying to understand how it works and incorporate it into my coding practices.
